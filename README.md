# CISC 324 (Operating Systems) Labs

Queen's University Operating Systems labs. 

Operating Systems is a course that provides students with an understanding of the fundamental concepts and technologies behind computer systems and the software that controls them. Through the course, students will learn about the following:

**System Architecture:** Students will learn about the different components that make up a computer system, including the hardware and software components, and how they interact with one another.

**Process Management:** Students will learn about how operating systems manage processes and threads, including how processes are created, scheduled, and terminated.

**Memory Management:** Students will learn about how operating systems manage memory, including memory allocation and deallocation, and how memory is used to support processes and applications.

**File Systems:** Students will learn about how operating systems manage and organize files, including file creation, deletion, and management.

**Security:** Students will learn about the various security measures that are used to protect computer systems, including encryption, firewalls, and access control.

**Concurrency and Synchronization:** Students will learn about the challenges of concurrent programming and how operating systems coordinate the execution of multiple processes and threads to ensure that they run efficiently and without interference.

Through the course, students will gain hands-on experience working with operating systems, both through laboratory exercises and programming assignments. This practical experience will help students to apply their theoretical knowledge and develop their skills in operating systems design and development.
